                Welcome to my modern interpretation of Isaac Guillory's online guitar school. 
                <br />
                <br />
                The <a href="https://anetstation.com/guillory/school/schoolindex.htm" target="_blank">original site</a> is still available however, I feel Isaac's legacy deserves an update.
                <br />
                <br />
                Isaac's inimitable style has been the single most profound influence on my own playing, and whilst I will never achieve the same levels of artistry and musicianship, I can build websites. 
                <br />
                <br />
                I have endeavoured to keep the content true to the original intention and have only corrected grammar and spelling where necessary. I have, however, taken the liberty of synchonising interval colours, and adapting the fretboard pictures to more closely reflect a tablature-type layout, I feel this approach may be more familiar to many guitar players and hopefully nothing is lost in translation.
                <br />
                <br />
                This is my tribute to the great Isaac Guillory. 
                <br />

                Welcome to the Isaac Guillory Guitar School 
                <br />
                An online music resource

            <p>
                The fingerboard has been around for almost a millennium, and harmony has been well established for nearly 400 years.  The harmonic structure of the fingerboard has given us all the guitar music we have ever heard.  The following is not subjective, it is simple music theory demonstrated visually on the fingerboard and applies to all guitars with twelve or more frets and six strings in standard tuning.
                <br />
                <br />
                Knowing where the intervals appear on the fingerboard is not much use if you don't know what they are or what they can do. Take your time. Learn to hear and identify the effect of every note in a chord. Examine your favourite chords, see what they have that makes you like them. and experiment with new voicings and inversions. These maps are to help you understand, and then expand your existing chord vocabulary.
                <br />
                <br />
                Most guitar students will find the introduction helpful. Advanced players can go directly to the interval maps by choosing one of the four chord shapes.
