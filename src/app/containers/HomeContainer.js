                Welcome to my modern web implementation of Isaac's online guitar school. 
                <br />
                <br />
                The original site is still available via archive.org's wayback machine, however, I feel Isaac's legacy deserves more than an achive.
                <br />
                <br />
                Isaac's inimitable playing style has been the single most profound influence on my own playing, and whilst I will never achieve the same levels of artistry and musicianship, I can build websites. 
                <br />
                <br />
                I have endeavoured to keep the content true to the original intention and have only corrected grammar and spelling where necessary. I have however taken the liberty of adjusting the fretboard layouts to more closely reflect tablature.
                <br />
                <br />
                This is my tribute to the late, great, Isaac Guillory. 
                <br />
                <br />

                The fingerboard has been around for almost a millennium, and harmony has been well established for nearly 400 years.  The harmonic structure of the fingerboard has given us all the guitar music we have ever heard.  The following is not subjective, it is simple music theory demonstrated visually on the fingerboard and applies to all guitars with twelve or more frets and six strings in standard tuning.
                <br />
                <br />
                Knowing where the intervals appear on the fingerboard is not much use if you don't know what they are or what they can do. Take your time. Learn to hear and identify the effect of every note in a chord. Examine your favourite chords, see what they have that makes you like them. and experiment with new voicings and inversions. These maps are to help you understand, and then expand your existing chord vocabulary.
                <br />
                <br />
                Most guitar students will find the introduction helpful. Advanced players can go directly to the interval maps by choosing one of the four chord shapes.
